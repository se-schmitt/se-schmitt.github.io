      - abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used
            for predicting transport properties of pure components over a wide
            range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion coefficients by
            entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We tackle this issue and
            present an entropy scaling framework for predicting mixture
            self-diffusion coefficients as well as mutual diffusion coefficients
            in a thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the
            mixture diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the
            self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the
            infinite-dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using
            information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from
            molecular-based equations of state. Examples for the application of
            the entropy scaling framework for the prediction of diffusion
            coefficients in mixtures illustrate its performance. It enables
            predictions over a wide range of temperatures and pressures
            including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable
            states---also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.
