- abstract: The density of five 1-alcohols (1-hexanol, 1heptanol,
    1-octanol, 1-nonanol, and 1-decanol) was measured using a
    vibrating-tube densimeter at pressures of up to 120 MPa for
    temperatures between 298.15 and 423.15 K. The relative expanded
    uncertainty of the experimental data is below 0.2%. The new results
    significantly extend the available literature data. The density of
    the five alcohols was modeled using four molecular-based equations
    of state (EOSs), namely PC-SAFT, SAFT-VR Mie, soft SAFT, and CPA.
    New component-specific EOS models were parametrized for all
    considered EOSs and substances using vapor−liquid equilibrium data
    from the literature and the density data from this work. The
    resulting EOS models describe the density with deviations of about
    0.2−1.5%. For the thermal second-order derivative properties, the
    relative deviations were 10−50% for the isothermal compressibility
    and 5−35% for the thermal expansion coefficient. Also, the
    extrapolation behavior of the EOS models was assessed. Overall, the
    best results were obtained from the SAFT-VR Mie EOS.

- abstract: A generalized data scheme for transferable classical force
    fields used in molecular simulations, i.e. molecular dynamics and
    Monte Carlo simulation, is presented. The data scheme is implemented
    in an SQL-based data format. The data scheme and data format is
    machine readable, re-usable, and interoperable. A transferable force
    field is a chemical construction plan specifying intermolecular and
    intramolecular interactions between different types of atoms or
    different chemical groups and can be used for building a model for a
    given component. The data scheme proposed in this work (named
    TUK-FFDat) formalizes digitally these chemical construction plans,
    i.e. transferable force fields. It can be applied to all-atom as
    well as united-atom transferable force fields. The general
    applicability of the data scheme is demonstrated for different types
    of force fields (TraPPE, OPLS-AA, and Potoff). Furthermore,
    conversion tools for translating the data scheme between .xls spread
    sheet format and the SQL-based data format are provided. The data
    format can readily be integrated in existing workflows, simulation
    engines, and force field databases as well as for linking such.

- abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations are an attractive tool for
    studying the fundamental mechanisms of lubricated machining
    processes on the atomistic scale as it is not possible to access the
    small contact zone experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations
    provide direct access to atomistic process properties of the contact
    zone of machining processes. In this work, lubricated machining
    processes were investigated, consisting of a workpiece, a tool, and
    a cutting fluid. The tool was fully immersed in the cutting fluid.
    Both, a simple model system and real substance systems were
    investigated. Using the simplified and generic model system, the
    influence of different process parameters and molecular interaction
    parameters were systematically studied. The real substance systems
    were used to represent specific real-world scenarios. The simulation
    results reveal that the fluid influences mainly the starting phase
    of an atomistic level cutting process by reducing the coefficient of
    friction in this phase compared to a dry case. After this starting
    phase of the lateral movement, the actual contact zone is mostly
    dry. For high pressure contacts, a tribofilm is formed between the
    workpiece and the cutting fluid, i.e. a significant amount of fluid
    particles is imprinted into the workpiece crystal structure. The
    presence of a cutting fluid significantly reduces the heat impact on
    the workpiece. Moreover, the cutting velocity is found to
    practically not influence the coefficient of friction, but
    significantly influences the dissipation and, therefore, the
    temperature in the contact zone. Finally, the reproducibility of the
    simulation method was assessed by studying replica sets of
    simulations of the model system.

- abstract: "Explosions of droplets that are caused by superheating of
    the liquid phase occur in many combustion processes but are
    difficult to investigate experimentally. We have studied this
    process for nanodroplets using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics
    simulations. Starting from an equilibrium state in which a spherical
    droplet is surrounded by a vapor phase, a local thermostat is used
    to impose a high temperature in a small control volume in the
    droplet center and the following process is studied for varying set
    temperatures. The fluid is modeled using the Lennard--Jones
    truncated and shifted potential. Depending on the set temperature,
    three different system responses were observed: (i) Low set
    temperatures lead to a shrinking of the droplet due to evaporation
    that follows the well-known d2 law. (ii) At intermediate set
    temperatures, a vapor bubble emerges in the droplet center and the
    liquid phase is formed into spherical shell that expands as the
    bubble inside of it grows. However, that spherical shell is only
    temporarily stable and eventually breaks apart. (iii) For high set
    temperatures, the abrupt and violent formation of the vapor bubble
    leads to an immediate breakup of the droplet. For case (ii),
    unexpected phenomena were observed. Oscillations in the diameter of
    the vapor bubble surrounded by the liquid film occurred. In some
    simulations, small holes formed temporarily in the liquid shell
    during its expansion, which closed again over the course of the
    simulation. Moreover, for one specific set temperature, a transition
    of the spherical droplet shell into a torus-like object was
    observed."

- abstract: "Nanoscale heat transfer across a solid--fluid interface was
    investigated by molecular dynamics simulations. The studied system
    consists of a fluid confined between two parallel plane atomistic
    walls. There is no convection. Both the fluid and the solid were
    modelled with the Lennard-Jones truncated and shifted potential. The
    following parameters were varied systematically: strength of
    solid--fluid and solid--solid interaction, mass of solid particles,
    temperature difference between fluid and solid, fluid temperature,
    fluid density, and channel width. From the simulation results,
    numbers for the Kapitza length LK were obtained, which characterises
    the heat transfer resistance at the solid--fluid interface. A
    correlation of the results for the Kapitza length LK as a function
    of the studied variables was developed. A dimensionless number is
    introduced, the Kapitza interface number Ki, which describes the
    Kapitza effect in the stagnant fluid and is zero in the absence of
    the Kapitza effect. It is known that the heat transfer resistance at
    the interface is generally not influenced by convection, such that
    the results from the present work can also be used to describe heat
    transfer with convection in cases in which the Kapitza effect plays
    a role, or simply to assess the influence of the Kapitza
    resistance."

- abstract: The prediction of thermophysical properties at extreme
    conditions is an important application of molecular simulations. The
    quality of these predictions primarily depends on the quality of the
    employed force field. In this work, a systematic comparison of
    classical transferable force fields for the prediction of different
    thermophysical properties of alkanes at extreme conditions, as they
    are encountered in tribological applications, was carried out using
    molecular dynamics simulations. Nine transferable force fields from
    three different classes were considered (all-atom, united-atom, and
    coarse-grained force fields). Three linear alkanes (n-decane,
    n-icosane, and n-triacontane) and two branched alkanes (1-decene
    trimer and squalane) were studied. Simulations were carried out in a
    pressure range between 0.1 and 400 MPa at 373.15 K. For each state
    point, density, viscosity, and self-diffusion coefficient were
    sampled, and the results were compared to experimental data. The
    Potoff force field yielded the best results.

- abstract: "Lubricated contact processes are studied using classical
    molecular dynamics simulations for determining the entire range of
    the Stribeck curve. Therefore, the lateral movement of two solid
    bodies at different gap height are studied. In each simulation, a
    rigid asperity is moved at constant height above a flat iron surface
    in a lubricating fluid. Both methane and decane are considered as
    lubricants. The three main lubrication regimes of the Stribeck curve
    and their transition regions are covered by the study: Boundary
    lubrication (significant elastic and plastic deformation of the
    substrate), mixed lubrication (adsorbed fluid layer dominates the
    process), and hydrodynamic lubrication (shear flow is set up between
    the surface and the asperity). We find the formation of a tribofilm
    in which lubricant molecules are immersed into the metal
    surface---not only in the case of scratching, but also for boundary
    lubrication and mixed lubrication. The formation of a tribofilm is
    found to have important consequences for the contact process.
    Moreover, the two fluids are found to show distinctly different
    behavior in the three lubrication regimes: For hydrodynamic
    lubrication (large gap height), decane yields a better tribological
    performance; for boundary lubrication (small gap height), decane
    shows a larger friction coefficient than methane, which is due to
    the different mechanisms observed for the formation of the
    tribofilm; the mixed lubrication regime can be considered as a
    transition regime between the two other regimes. Moreover, it is
    found that the nature of the tribofilm depends on the lubricant:
    While methane particles substitute substrate atoms sustaining mostly
    the crystalline structure, the decane molecules distort the
    substrate surface and an amorphous tribofilm is formed."

- abstract: Lubricants play a central role in many technical
    applications, e.g. in bearings and gears as well as in machining
    processes. In such applications, lubricants are exposed to extreme
    conditions in the contact area. In lubrication gaps, the pressure
    can reach values up to 5 GPa. The thermophysical properties of
    lubricants, and in particular the viscosity, at such extreme
    conditions have an important influence on the friction and wear
    behavior of a tribosystem. Accordingly, reliable lubricant property
    models are a prerequisite for accurate tribological simulations,
    e.g. elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) simulations. Presently,
    the vast majority of experimental thermophysical property data are
    only available up to 1 GPa. Thus, reliable and robust models with
    strong extrapolation capabilities to higher pressure are required.
    In this work, viscosity measurements of squalane in a temperature
    range between 20 °C and 100 °C and pressures up to 1 GPa were
    carried out. Based on that data, a physical model for the viscosity
    was developed. The model is built by combining a molecular-based
    equation of state with the so-called entropy scaling approach.
    Finally, we demonstrate how this fluid property model can be
    favorably integrated in an EHL simulation by an application
    programming interface (API). The novel hybrid modeling approach is
    promising for future applications.

- abstract: Entropy scaling is a powerful technique that has been used
    successfully for predicting transport properties of pure components
    over a wide range of states. However, modeling mixture diffusion
    coefficients by entropy scaling is an unresolved task. We have
    tackled this issue and present an entropy scaling framework for
    predicting mixture self-diffusion as well as mutual diffusion in a
    thermodynamically consistent way. The predictions of the mixture
    diffusion coefficients are made based on information on the
    self-diffusion coefficients of the pure components and the infinite
    dilution diffusion coefficients. This is accomplished using
    information on the entropy of the mixture, which is taken here from
    molecular-based equations of state. The framework is flexible and
    can be applied together with any equation of state. Examples for the
    application of the new entropy scaling framework for the prediction
    of diffusion coefficients in mixtures illustrate its impressive
    performance. It enables predictions a wide range of temperatures and
    pressures including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable
    states - also for strongly non-ideal mixtures.

- abstract: "Knowledge on transport properties of fluids is important
    for the design of many industrial processes in chemical and
    mechanical engineering, but experimental data are often scarce.
    Therefore, reliable models for predicting transport properties are
    required. In the present thesis, two ways for modeling transport
    properties were explored, which both stem from the field of
    molecular thermodynamics: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
    entropy scaling. In both fields, various open questions were
    addressed: A comprehensive database on MD simulation data of the
    viscosity, thermal conductivity, and self-diffusion coefficient of
    the Lennard-Jones fluid was established. The assessment of the data
    yields, among others, insights in the reproducibility of the
    simulation of transport properties. Moreover, the results obtained
    from different force fields for the transport properties of a set of
    lubricants at very high pressures were compared, with the aim of
    identifying force fields that are suitable for modeling lubricants.
    By extending an online force field database to transferable force
    fields, their application in molecular simulations was facilitated.
    Furthermore, detailed studies of the heat transfer across
    solid-liquid interfaces on the nanoscopic level were carried out by
    non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. In contrast
    to MD simulations, entropy scaling provides an analytical theory for
    modeling transport properties based on equations of state (EOS). The
    reliability of the underlying EOS model is crucial for the
    application of entropy scaling. Therefore, new EOS models were
    parameterized for alcohols and their extrapolation ability was
    tested. This was done based on high-pressure density data measured
    in this work. A new entropy scaling framework was developed that
    covers the entire fluid region. The framework was successfully
    applied for modeling the viscosity, the thermal conductivity, and
    the self-diffusion coefficient of different fluids in a wide range
    of states based on few experimental data. The excellent
    extrapolation behavior of the method is demonstrated. The approach
    was also extended to modeling diffusion coefficients in mixtures.
    This enables, for the first time, the prediction of self-diffusion

- abstract: The viscosity of 1-octanol was determined experimentally and
    modeled using both empirical as well as physical models. The
    viscosity of liquid 1-octanol was measured using a falling-body
    viscometer at pressures up to 600 MPa and temperatures between
    293.15 K and 373.15 K. For the physics-based modeling, entropy
    scaling in combination with a molecular-based equation of state,
    namely SAFT-VR Mie, was used. Also for the evaluation of the
    viscosity measurements, the SAFT-VR Mie EOS was used for describing
    the density of the fluid. The new viscosity data significantly
    extend the available literature data. For the new experimental data,
    the relative expanded uncertainty is below 10% for most data points.
    Moreover, an empirical model was developed to represent experimental
    data from this work. Finally, the entropy scaling model was employed
    and tested for describing the viscosity of 1-octanol in a wide range
    of states including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable
    states. It describes all available experimental data well and is
    robust when used for extrapolations.
