The relative expanded uncertainty of the experimental data is below 0.2\%. The new results significantly extend the available literature data. The density of the five alcohols was modeled using four molecular-based equations of state (EOSs), namely PC-SAFT, SAFT-VR Mie, soft SAFT, and CPA. New component-specific EOS models were parametrized for all considered EOSs and substances using vapor−liquid equilibrium data from the literature and the density data from this work. The resulting EOS models describe the density with deviations of about 0.2−1.5\%. For the thermal second-order derivative properties, the relative deviations were 10−50\% for the isothermal compressibility and 5−35\% for the thermal expansion coefficient. Also, the extrapolation behavior of the EOS models was assessed. Overall, the best results were obtained from the SAFT-VR Mie EOS.},

The general applicability of the data scheme is demonstrated for different types of force fields (TraPPE, OPLS-AA, and Potoff).

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics simulations are an attractive tool for studying the fundamental mechanisms of lubricated machining processes on the atomistic scale as it is not possible to access the small contact zone experimentally. Molecular dynamics simulations provide direct access to atomistic process properties of the contact zone of machining processes. In this work, lubricated machining processes were investigated, consisting of a workpiece, a tool, and a cutting fluid. The tool was fully immersed in the cutting fluid. Both, a simple model system and real substance systems were investigated. Using the simplified and generic model system, the influence of different process parameters and molecular interaction parameters were systematically studied. The real substance systems were used to represent specific real-world scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the fluid influences mainly the starting phase of an atomistic level cutting process by reducing the coefficient of friction in this phase compared to a dry case. After this starting phase of the lateral movement, the actual contact zone is mostly dry. For high pressure contacts, a tribofilm is formed between the workpiece and the cutting fluid, i.e. a significant amount of fluid particles is imprinted into the workpiece crystal structure. The presence of a cutting fluid significantly reduces the heat impact on the workpiece. Moreover, the cutting velocity is found to practically not influence the coefficient of friction, but significantly influences the dissipation and, therefore, the temperature in the contact zone. Finally, the reproducibility of the simulation method was assessed by studying replica sets of simulations of the model system.},

We have studied this process for nanodroplets using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Starting from an equilibrium state in which a spherical droplet is surrounded by a vapor phase, a local thermostat is used to impose a high temperature in a small control volume in the droplet center and the following process is studied for varying set temperatures. The fluid is modeled using the Lennard–Jones truncated and shifted potential. Depending on the set temperature, three different system responses were observed: (i) Low set temperatures lead to a shrinking of the droplet due to evaporation that follows the well-known d2 law. (ii) At intermediate set temperatures, a vapor bubble emerges in the droplet center and the liquid phase is formed into spherical shell that expands as the bubble inside of it grows. However, that spherical shell is only temporarily stable and eventually breaks apart. (iii) For high set temperatures, the abrupt and violent formation of the vapor bubble leads to an immediate breakup of the droplet. For case (ii), unexpected phenomena were observed. Oscillations in the diameter of the vapor bubble surrounded by the liquid film occurred. In some simulations, small holes formed temporarily in the liquid shell during its expansion, which closed again over the course of the simulation. Moreover, for one specific set temperature, a transition of the spherical droplet shell into a torus-like object was observed.},

The studied system consists of a fluid confined between two parallel plane atomistic walls. There is no convection. Both the fluid and the solid were modelled with the Lennard-Jones truncated and shifted potential. The following parameters were varied systematically: strength of solid–fluid and solid–solid interaction, mass of solid particles, temperature difference between fluid and solid, fluid temperature, fluid density, and channel width. From the simulation results, numbers for the Kapitza length LK were obtained, which characterises the heat transfer resistance at the solid–fluid interface. A correlation of the results for the Kapitza length LK as a function of the studied variables was developed. A dimensionless number is introduced, the Kapitza interface number Ki, which describes the Kapitza effect in the stagnant fluid and is zero in the absence of the Kapitza effect. It is known that the heat transfer resistance at the interface is generally not influenced by convection, such that the results from the present work can also be used to describe heat transfer with convection in cases in which the Kapitza effect plays a role, or simply to assess the influence of the Kapitza resistance.},

In this work, a systematic comparison of classical transferable force fields for the prediction of different thermophysical properties of alkanes at extreme conditions, as they are encountered in tribological applications, was carried out using molecular dynamics simulations. Nine transferable force fields from three different classes were considered (all-atom, united-atom, and coarse-grained force fields). Three linear alkanes (n-decane, n-icosane, and n-triacontane) and two branched alkanes (1-decene trimer and squalane) were studied. Simulations were carried out in a pressure range between 0.1 and 400 MPa at 373.15 K. For each state point, density, viscosity, and self-diffusion coefficient were sampled, and the results were compared to experimental data. The Potoff force field yielded the best results.},

	abstract = {Lubricated contact processes are studied using classical molecular dynamics simulations for determining the entire range of the Stribeck curve. Therefore, the lateral movement of two solid bodies at different gap height are studied. In each simulation, a rigid asperity is moved at constant height above a flat iron surface in a lubricating fluid. Both methane and decane are considered as lubricants. The three main lubrication regimes of the Stribeck curve and their transition regions are covered by the study: Boundary lubrication (significant elastic and plastic deformation of the substrate), mixed lubrication (adsorbed fluid layer dominates the process), and hydrodynamic lubrication (shear flow is set up between the surface and the asperity). We find the formation of a tribofilm in which lubricant molecules are immersed into the metal surface—not only in the case of scratching, but also for boundary lubrication and mixed lubrication. The formation of a tribofilm is found to have important consequences for the contact process. Moreover, the two fluids are found to show distinctly different behavior in the three lubrication regimes: For hydrodynamic lubrication (large gap height), decane yields a better tribological performance; for boundary lubrication (small gap height), decane shows a larger friction coefficient than methane, which is due to the different mechanisms observed for the formation of the tribofilm; the mixed lubrication regime can be considered as a transition regime between the two other regimes. Moreover, it is found that the nature of the tribofilm depends on the lubricant: While methane particles substitute substrate atoms sustaining mostly the crystalline structure, the decane molecules distort the substrate surface and an amorphous tribofilm is formed.},

	abstract = {Lubricants play a central role in many technical applications, e.g. in bearings and gears as well as in machining processes. In such applications, lubricants are exposed to extreme conditions in the contact area. In lubrication gaps, the pressure can reach values up to 5 GPa. The thermophysical properties of lubricants, and in particular the viscosity, at such extreme conditions have an important influence on the friction and wear behavior of a tribosystem. Accordingly, reliable lubricant property models are a prerequisite for accurate tribological simulations, e.g. elastohydrodynamic lubrication (EHL) simulations. Presently, the vast majority of experimental thermophysical property data are only available up to 1 GPa. Thus, reliable and robust models with strong extrapolation capabilities to higher pressure are required. In this work, viscosity measurements of squalane in a temperature range between 20 °C and 100 °C and pressures up to 1 GPa were carried out. Based on that data, a physical model for the viscosity was developed. The model is built by combining a molecular-based equation of state with the so-called entropy scaling approach. Finally, we demonstrate how this fluid property model can be favorably integrated in an EHL simulation by an application programming interface (API). The novel hybrid modeling approach is promising for future applications.},

	abstract = {Knowledge on transport properties of fluids is important for the design of many industrial processes in chemical and mechanical engineering, but experimental data are often scarce. Therefore, reliable models for predicting transport properties are required. In the present thesis, two ways for modeling transport properties were explored, which both stem from the field of molecular thermodynamics: Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and entropy scaling. In both fields, various open questions were addressed: A comprehensive database on MD simulation data of the viscosity, thermal conductivity, and self-diffusion coefficient of the Lennard-Jones fluid was established. The assessment of the data yields, among others, insights in the reproducibility of the simulation of transport properties. Moreover, the results obtained from different force fields for the transport properties of a set of lubricants at very high pressures were compared, with the aim of identifying force fields that are suitable for modeling lubricants. By extending an online force field database to transferable force fields, their application in molecular simulations was facilitated. Furthermore, detailed studies of the heat transfer across solid-liquid interfaces on the nanoscopic level were carried out by non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. In contrast to MD simulations, entropy scaling provides an analytical theory for modeling transport properties based on equations of state (EOS). The reliability of the underlying EOS model is crucial for the application of entropy scaling. Therefore, new EOS models were parameterized for alcohols and their extrapolation ability was tested. This was done based on high-pressure density data measured in this work. A new entropy scaling framework was developed that covers the entire fluid region. The framework was successfully applied for modeling the viscosity, the thermal conductivity, and the self-diffusion coefficient of different fluids in a wide range of states based on few experimental data. The excellent extrapolation behavior of the method is demonstrated. The approach was also extended to modeling diffusion coefficients in mixtures. This enables, for the first time, the prediction of self-diffusion coefficients and mutual diffusion coefficients in binary mixtures in a consistent way.},

	abstract = {The viscosity of 1-octanol was determined experimentally and modeled using both empirical as well as physical models. The viscosity of liquid 1-octanol was measured using a falling-body viscometer at pressures up to 600 MPa and temperatures between 293.15 K and 373.15 K. For the physics-based modeling, entropy scaling in combination with a molecular-based equation of state, namely SAFT-VR Mie, was used. Also for the evaluation of the viscosity measurements, the SAFT-VR Mie EOS was used for describing the density of the fluid. The new viscosity data significantly extend the available literature data. For the new experimental data, the relative expanded uncertainty is below 10\% for most data points. Moreover, an empirical model was developed to represent experimental data from this work. Finally, the entropy scaling model was employed and tested for describing the viscosity of 1-octanol in a wide range of states including gaseous, liquid, supercritical, and metastable states. It describes all available experimental data well and is robust when used for extrapolations.},
